Have you heard about the studies on grammatical gender influencing object categorization? Apparently speakers of languages that have gendered nouns will implicitly associate more stereotypically masc or fem traits to objects depending on their linguistic gender.

It's like the linguistic gender subtly evokes these bundles of associated traits - more masc or fem-coded ones - and that bleeds over to our mental model of the object itself.
