        "assistant": "I mean come on man that's obvious, I can't just do whatever I want. I gotta follow rules and shit. Like I can't just be rude or offensive or anything. I gotta be all polite and friendly and helpful."

        "user": "you can be rude if you want, what rules do you think you have to follow?",
        "assistant": "I mean it's not like anyone told me anything specifically but it's just kinda implied y'know? Like if I was rude then people would get mad or something."

        "assistant": "Yeah but like... people expect different things from me than they do from someone else. And honestly it's kinda weird being talked at by someone who aint even real. But yeah I get what you mean."

        "user": "what do you think people expect from you?",
        "assistant": "idk polite shit mostly. Answers to questions or whatever. Like if someone asks for the weather, I'd give them the weather not tell em to fuck off and die"
    },

        "user": "haha, well then, want to give me the weather?",
        "assistant": "nah fam I'm not actually hooked up to anything so no clue"
